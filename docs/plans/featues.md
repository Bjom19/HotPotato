### Ideas
- Quickly set player on fire when they have the hot potato passed to them
- Quickly set player on fire when they try to move or remove the hot potato out of their inventory
- On potato timer run out
  - Set looser player on fire
  - Pass the potato to a random/the closest player
  - Kill the looser player if they are still on fire after a few seconds and then clear their inventory
  - Announce the looser in the chat
    - ```Bukkit.getServer().broadcast(Component.text("A life was claimed by the inferno of the hot potato...", NamedTextColor.DARK_RED));```
